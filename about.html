               My name is Albert Emanuel F. Miaral, 19 years old living in Blk 98 Lot 18 Purok 4 kawal st. Caloocan City. My birthday is June 7, 2003.

               My favorite color is green, my Hobie is watching anime, I don't watch it all the time, I only do that when I finish my chores at home, I help my mother first before I do everything I want and before I use my cellphone . I want to play a basketball. After I finish my homework, my brothers and I play basketball every morning. As for the subjects, I'm pretty good at it, so I can't do everything, I'm not good at it, I just know what I've learned.
                <br>
                 For the knowledge of others, I used to be shy when I was in high school, I was the shy type who would only ask other people, I'm shy now, but I'm not shy forever, I lost my shyness in grade 11 because my mother told me not to too shy because it's for me too. So since I was in junior high and now in college, I'm not ashamed to ask others. And as for studying, I want to graduate because that's the only thing I can be proud of in my life, that's all, thank you.
